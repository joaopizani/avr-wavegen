AVR-Wavegen: The Humble AVR Wave Generation Library
---------------------------------------------------

Thanks for your interest! This is a collection of related static libraries (pieces of software intended to be
used as .a files) that generate and manipulate square waveforms in AVR microcontrollers. More specifically,
our goal is to generate sound signals, transmit them in a number of ways and use these signals in yet another
number of ways...

Currently, the suite consists of a library for sound tone generation (in the avrtone subdir) and two libraries
for trasmitting the tones generated by avrtone:  the ones in the avram and avrbuzzer subdirs.

As the name implies, avram is supposed to transmit the signal from avrtone using old-but-good Amplitude
Modulated radio frequencies. avrbuzzer, on the other hand, outputs the tones directly to a digital output pin
on the microcontroller. There are also some integration tests (small programs testing some combination of
libraries) in the integration-tests subdir.

All subdirectories have a README file by themselves, so you might consider taking a look over those files as
well... Have fun! :) Please feel free to fork, comment, post issues and submit pull requests.
