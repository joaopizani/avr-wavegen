Each subdirectory inside this one has a program that is supposed to test a specific combination of
frontend+backend from the avr-wavegen library suite.

For each test program directory, you can find a Makefile inside of it. All makefiles work similarly:

- To compile the program, type "make" and to clean all generated files type "make clean"
- Type "make install" to transfer a HEX file into your AVR using avrdude.

You might need to change some parameters in the Makefiles to adapt them to your device, USB port, etc. The
Makefiles are well-commented and should be pretty self-explanatory... :)
