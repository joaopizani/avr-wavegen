This is the AVR Tone Generation Library (libavrtone.a). It consists of one C source file (src/avrtone.c) with
functions to help setup the timer used for wave generation, along with the all-important function...

playTone(uint16_t f_Hz, uint16_t dur_ms)

This function receives as parameters the frequency (in Hertz) of the sound wave to be generated, and the
duration of this sound. After execution of this function finishes, the output becomes again silent. Because of
parameters of the atmega system such as system clock frequency and timer prescaler range, the following
restrictions apply to the frequency and duration parameters:

- f_Hz better be bellow some 5000Hz. Otherwise, undefined behavioral (with probably lots of aliasing) ensues.
- dur_ms must be less then or equal to 4000 (4 seconds). I cannot guarantee anything higher than that...


To compile this module, use the command ./compile.sh. Then you can gather the object files into a static
library (.a) using "avr-ar". If you want to add other files and functions to this module, add them to the
compile.sh script respectively.
